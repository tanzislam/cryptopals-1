==========

These are cryptopals/Matasano crypto challenges answers.

There are **SPOILERS WITHIN**!

The main place to start is the [Makefile](Makefile) which will build everything, and then run:

* [run-tests-1.sh](run-tests-1.sh)
* [run-tests-2.sh](run-tests-2.sh)
* [run-tests-3.sh](run-tests-3.sh)
* [run-tests-4.sh](run-tests-4.sh)
* [run-tests-5.sh](run-tests-5.sh)
* [run-tests-6.sh](run-tests-6.sh)
* [run-tests-7.sh](run-tests-7.sh)

Which are executable versions of the challenges.
